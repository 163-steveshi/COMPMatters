# COMPMatters

## GitHub Exercise

1. First create a GitHub student account.
2. Make a _Fork_ of this repository.
3. Create a new _Branch_ called something like `name-add-initials` (where name is your name or initials).
4. In your new Branch, open the `initials.py` file. Then, modify the file by adding code to draw your initials after all other initials currently in the code are drawn. Be sure to reset the turtle after your initials are drawn. 
5. In the Commit changes section (bottom of the window), add a description of the change you made to the file and then _Commit changes_.
6. Go to the main page of your repository and make a _Pull request_.
7. Describe the changes you want to make to the original `initials.py` file and _Create Pull Request_.
