# COMPMatters

## GitHub Exercise

1. First create a GitHub student account if you don't already have one. https://education.github.com/students
2. Log in to your account and then read the quick intro to git/GitHub. https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/
3. Come back to this page. https://github.com/mjhinek/COMPMatters
4. Make a _Fork_ of this repository. (This copies the COMPMatters repository into your github account)
5. In your fork, create a new _Branch_ called something like `name-add-initials`, where name is your name or initials. (a branch is yet another copy/version of the code)
6. In your new Branch, open the `initials.py` file. Modify the file by adding code to draw your initials after all other initials currently in the code are drawn. Be sure to reset the turtle (`t.reset()`) after your initials are drawn. 
7. In the _Commit changes_ section (bottom of the edit window), add a description of the changes you made to the file and then click _Commit changes_. (This saves your changes to your copy of `initials.py`).
8. Go to the main page of your repository and make a _Pull request_. (This lets others know that you made changes to the code. A decision to merge your code into the original code can then be made.)
9. Describe the changes you want to make to the original `initials.py` file and then click _Create Pull Request_.
